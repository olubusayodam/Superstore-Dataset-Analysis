# Project Name: Superstore-Dataset-Analysis

## Overview
The Superstore dataset consists of 21 columns and 99,944 rows, offering a comprehensive view of the company's operations. In response to escalating market competition, the Superstore seeks strategic insights to optimize products, regions, categories, and customer segments.

## Project Objective
The primary objective is to analyze patterns within the dataset, providing actionable business insights. Additionally, there's an opportunity to build a regression model for predicting either sales or profit to enhance decision-making.

## Dataset Composition
